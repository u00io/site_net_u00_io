<h1>What Is CIDR Notation?</h1>

<p>
CIDR notation is a simple way to describe how IPv4 networks are divided.
It is used instead of long subnet masks and makes network configuration
easier to read and understand.
</p>

<p>
You may have already seen CIDR notation written like this:
</p>

<pre>
192.168.1.0/24
10.0.0.0/8
</pre>

<p>
The number after the slash indicates how many bits are used for the
network portion of the IP address.
</p>

<h2>Why CIDR notation exists</h2>

<p>
In the early days of the internet, IP addresses were divided into fixed
classes: Class A, Class B, and Class C. Each class had a predefined subnet
mask.
</p>

<p>
This approach wasted a large number of IP addresses. Many networks were
either too large or too small for the fixed class sizes.
</p>

<p>
CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) was introduced to remove these
limitations. It allows networks to be split into flexible sizes based on
actual needs.
</p>

<h2>How CIDR notation works</h2>

<p>
An IPv4 address consists of 32 bits. CIDR notation simply tells how many
of those bits belong to the network.
</p>

<p>
For example:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>/8</strong> means 8 bits for the network and 24 bits for hosts</li>
  <li><strong>/16</strong> means 16 bits for the network and 16 bits for hosts</li>
  <li><strong>/24</strong> means 24 bits for the network and 8 bits for hosts</li>
</ul>

<p>
The remaining bits are used to identify individual devices within the
network.
</p>

<h2>CIDR notation and subnet masks</h2>

<p>
CIDR notation is directly related to subnet masks. Each CIDR prefix
corresponds to a specific subnet mask.
</p>

<p>
Here are some common examples:
</p>

<pre>
/8  → 255.0.0.0
/16 → 255.255.0.0
/24 → 255.255.255.0
</pre>

<p>
While subnet masks show the same information, CIDR notation is shorter
and easier to read.
</p>

<h2>Why CIDR notation is useful</h2>

<p>
CIDR notation is widely used because it simplifies many networking tasks.
It makes configurations clearer and reduces errors.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>It allows flexible network sizes</li>
  <li>It reduces wasted IP addresses</li>
  <li>It makes routing and firewall rules easier to understand</li>
  <li>It is commonly used in cloud and enterprise networks</li>
</ul>

<h2>Common CIDR examples</h2>

<p>
Some CIDR prefixes are used very frequently in practice:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>/24</strong> — small networks (256 total addresses)</li>
  <li><strong>/16</strong> — medium-sized networks</li>
  <li><strong>/8</strong> — very large networks</li>
  <li><strong>/32</strong> — a single IP address</li>
</ul>

<p>
These prefixes help quickly understand the size of a network without
doing manual calculations.
</p>

<h2>How to convert a subnet mask to CIDR</h2>

<p>
To convert a subnet mask to CIDR notation, you count the number of
consecutive <strong>1</strong> bits in the mask.
</p>

<p>
For example, the subnet mask <code>255.255.255.0</code> contains 24
network bits, so it corresponds to <code>/24</code>.

</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>
CIDR notation is a compact and flexible way to describe IPv4 networks.
It replaces rigid class-based addressing and makes modern networking
simpler and more efficient.
</p>

<p>
Understanding CIDR helps you read network configurations, design address
spaces, and troubleshoot routing issues more easily.
