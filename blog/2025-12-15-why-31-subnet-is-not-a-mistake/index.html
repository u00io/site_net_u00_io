<p>
At first glance, a /31 IPv4 subnet looks wrong. Two addresses, no broadcast,
no “usable host range” — everything that traditional subnetting rules tell you
should not exist.
</p>

<p>
And yet, /31 is not a hack, not a workaround, and not a violation of the IPv4
model. It is a fully standardized and widely used solution for a very specific
type of network link.
</p>

<h2>Where the Confusion Comes From</h2>

<p>
The classic IPv4 subnet model assumes that every subnet needs three distinct
address roles: a network address, a broadcast address, and one or more host
addresses in between.
</p>

<p>
With a /30 subnet, this model fits perfectly: four addresses, two usable hosts,
one network, one broadcast. This pattern became so ingrained that it was often
treated as a law of nature rather than a design choice.
</p>

<p>
A /31 subnet breaks that mental model. With only two addresses available,
there is no room for a dedicated network or broadcast address. Both addresses
must be usable — or the subnet would be pointless.
</p>

<h2>Point-to-Point Links Change the Rules</h2>

<p>
On a point-to-point link, there are exactly two devices. No third host will ever
appear. No broadcast discovery is required. No ambiguity exists about where a
packet should go.
</p>

<p>
In this context, the concept of a broadcast address becomes redundant. Any
packet sent to “the other side” has only one possible destination.
</p>

<p>
Once you accept that broadcast is unnecessary for point-to-point links, the
need for a larger subnet disappears as well.
</p>

<h2>The Standardization of /31</h2>

<p>
This idea was formalized in RFC 3021. The RFC explicitly allows both addresses
in a /31 subnet to be treated as host addresses, provided the subnet is used
exclusively for point-to-point links.
</p>

<p>
There is no special signaling, no protocol extensions, and no magic behavior.
The only requirement is that both endpoints agree that the link is point-to-point.
</p>

<h2>Why This Matters in Practice</h2>

<p>
Using /31 subnets cuts IPv4 address consumption in half compared to /30 for
point-to-point links. For large networks with thousands of inter-router links,
this is not an optimization — it is a necessity.
</p>

<p>
This is why /31 is common in ISP backbones, BGP peering links, and internal
routing infrastructure.
</p>

<h2>Why Some Equipment Still Fails</h2>

<p>
Older network stacks and poorly written firmware sometimes assume that the
first address in a subnet is always “the network” and the last is always
“broadcast”.
</p>

<p>
When such assumptions are hardcoded, /31 subnets appear broken — not because
they violate the protocol, but because the implementation violates the
specification.
</p>

<h2>The Real Lesson</h2>

<p>
A /31 subnet is a reminder that IP addressing rules are not mathematical
truths. They are engineering decisions, shaped by assumptions about how a
network is used.
</p>

<p>
When those assumptions change, the rules can — and sometimes must — change
with them.
