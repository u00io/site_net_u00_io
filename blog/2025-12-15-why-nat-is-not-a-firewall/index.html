<h1>Why NAT Is Not a Firewall</h1>

<p>
Network Address Translation is often described as a security feature. Many
networks rely on NAT with the assumption that it “blocks incoming traffic” and
therefore provides protection similar to a firewall.
</p>

<p>
This assumption is widespread, convenient — and fundamentally incorrect.
</p>

<h2>What NAT Actually Does</h2>

<p>
At its core, NAT rewrites packet headers. It changes source or destination
addresses (and often ports) so that multiple internal hosts can share a single
external IP address.
</p>

<p>
That is all. No security model is implied. No policy is enforced. NAT does not
decide which traffic is allowed or forbidden — it only translates addresses.
</p>

<h2>Why NAT Looks Like Protection</h2>

<p>
In most consumer setups, NAT is combined with state tracking. Outbound
connections create temporary translation entries, and only packets matching
those entries are forwarded back inside.
</p>

<p>
From the outside, unsolicited inbound packets are dropped. This behavior feels
like filtering, even though the decision is based on translation state, not on
security rules.
</p>

<h2>State Is Not Policy</h2>

<p>
A firewall enforces intent. It answers questions like: which hosts may talk to
which services, under which conditions, and in which direction.
</p>

<p>
NAT answers a different question entirely: how should packet addresses be
rewritten so replies can find their way back.
</p>

<p>
The fact that both mechanisms track state does not make them equivalent.
</p>

<h2>Where the Illusion Breaks</h2>

<p>
As soon as you add port forwarding, NAT stops looking protective. Incoming
connections are suddenly allowed — not because the network became less secure,
but because translation rules were added.
</p>

<p>
At this point it becomes clear that NAT was never making a security decision.
It was merely following mapping rules.
</p>

<h2>Why This Matters Architecturally</h2>

<p>
Designing a network under the assumption that NAT provides security leads to
fragile systems. When the topology changes, or when IPv6 removes the need for
NAT entirely, the illusion collapses.
</p>

<p>
Security should be explicit, inspectable, and intentional. NAT provides none
of these properties.
</p>

<h2>The Takeaway</h2>

<p>
NAT can hide addresses. It can complicate scanning. It can reduce accidental
exposure.
</p>

<p>
But none of these effects make it a firewall.
