<h1>Why You Can`t Reliably Detect Network Quality with Ping</h1>

<p>
    Ping is often the first tool used to “check the network”. A few milliseconds of
    latency and zero packet loss are commonly interpreted as proof that everything
    is working well.
</p>

<p>
    Unfortunately, ping answers a much narrower question than most people think.
</p>

<h2>What Ping Actually Measures</h2>

<p>
    Ping sends ICMP Echo Request packets and measures how long it takes to receive
    the corresponding Echo Replies.
</p>

<p>
    This measures the round-trip time of a very specific type of traffic, handled
    by a very specific code path in the network stack and in intermediate devices.
</p>

<h2>ICMP Is Not Data Traffic</h2>

<p>
    ICMP packets are frequently treated differently from TCP or UDP traffic.
    They may be deprioritized, rate-limited, or even handled by the control plane
    instead of the fast forwarding path.
</p>

<p>
    As a result, ICMP latency can be higher or lower than the latency experienced
    by actual application traffic.
</p>

<h2>Queues Matter More Than Distance</h2>

<p>
    Most real-world latency spikes are caused by queueing, not by propagation
    delay. Ping packets are small and infrequent, so they often bypass congestion
    effects that impact bulk data transfers.
</p>

<p>
    A network can respond to ping with stable low latency while still delivering
    poor throughput or high jitter for real workloads.
</p>

<h2>Packet Loss Is Not Symmetric</h2>
<p>
    Ping measures loss of ICMP packets in both directions combined. It does not
    tell you where the loss occurs, or whether only one direction is affected.
</p>
<p>
    Many applications are sensitive to loss in one direction only, which ping
    cannot isolate.
</p>

<h2>When Ping Is Still Useful</h2>
<p>
    Ping is excellent for detecting basic reachability and gross failures. If
    packets do not come back at all, something is clearly broken.
</p>
<p>
    Beyond that, ping is best treated as a liveness probe — not a quality metric.
</p>

<h2>The Takeaway</h2>
<p>
    Ping is easy to use, widely available, and often misleading.
</p>
<p>
    It confirms that a path exists. It does not tell you how well that path serves
    real traffic.
